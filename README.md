# marvel-characters

This is a fork of the [marvel-characters](https://github.com/mattdesl/marvel-characters) project. On my team we use marvel character names for each of the different test clusters we create. This extends the original project by exporting more than just the character names.

The `characters.json` contains the following information from the marvel API:

 * Id
 * Name
 * Description
 * Thumbnail
 * Links
 * Short Name - Shorter, unique name suitable for a generated hostname. Has the following rules:
   * Strip off the variation of a character (in the API as NAME (VARIATION)  )
   * Replace any whitespace with '-'
   * Remove any non-word characters
   * Restrict the length to 22 characters

## Running From Source

Clone & install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chrisdail/marvel-characters.git
cd marvel-characters
npm install
```

You will need a Marvel Developer account. Once you have API keys, copy them into a `.marvel-charactersrc` file in the same directory. It should look like this, with your keys:

```json
{
  "privateKey": "egadg545151232d02ea0b9asdfasdfd5699a",
  "publicKey": "badsg1cbadsggagafdh0"
}
```

Then use `npm start` to scrape the new data.
